Hi!
This is the POC project to explore the React JS knowledge with developing the React Web Application for the E-Commerce site.

## Development flow
 1. [Clone the Repository](../../#clone-the-Repository)
 2. [Create the new branch](../../#create-new-branch)
 3. [Commit and Push the changes](../../#create-new-branch)
 4. [Create the PR for Dev Push](../../#create-the-PR-for-dev-push)
 5. [Test on Dev Site](../../#test-on-live-site)
 4. [Create the PR for Live Push](../../#create-the-PR-for-live-push)
 5. [Test to Live site](../../#test-on-live-site)

## Get Started
### Clone the Repository
Use the following git command to clone the repository to your local directory
```git
git clone https://github.com/SeenivasanBalakrishnan/ai-mirror-react-poc.git
```
### Create new branch
Create new branch from the `development` branch using following git command
```git
git checkout -b new_branch_name origin/development
```
Example:
```git
git checkout -b development-seeni-home-page origin/development
```
Always use the following naming convention to create the new branches
> development-USERNAME-MODULE-NAME

Example: `development-seeni-home-page`

And usual commit the changes and push to the current branch.

### Create the PR for Dev Push
Create the PR to push the code to the `development` branch. Once it approved you can merge the branch.

### Test on Dev site

### Create the PR for Live Push
